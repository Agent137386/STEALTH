Welcome,

STEALTH (Secure Text Encoder and Archive With Latest Techniques), Was designed to make note taking for DoD Agents easier. 
Each Agent has a different process for taking and tracking their notes, some use outlook notes (Almost Obsolite), OneNote, Notepad, Microsoft Word, and many others.
But each program has it's flaws, STEALTH seeks to eliminate those flaws.

How To Use STEALTH.

- Entering your Employee ID stays present unless you refresh the webpage.

- Selecting Copy & Save copies the text to your clipboard & saves it below in a log.

-  Once youâ€™ve finished your shift or need to reboot select download notes, this will download all notes in a single text document with the date and timestamp.
